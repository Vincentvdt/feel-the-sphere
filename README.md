## Description
"Today, marks day #1 that we're going to begin learning Three.js together. I've always wanted to create immersive webgl experiences, but I never sat for long enough and gave it a go. Recently, that's changed -- and I'm going to share what I've learned with you in order to create some awesome examples. Three.js allows you to harness the power of WebGL in order to create 3D experiences in the browser. There's so much to learn, and today is just our first step. In the future, we're going to be creating more elaborate examples."
